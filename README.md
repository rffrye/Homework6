Weather Dashboard

## Functionality 

In this weather dashboard the user inputs a city and clicks the search button or presses the enter key.  This will return current weather conditions in the chose location.  It will also show the 5 day forecast of that same location below in five separate dynamically updated divs.  Using local storage, the browser will recall past chosen cities and display them after the user clicks on one from the list.  

## Technologies Used

The framework was built using HTMl and a Bootstrap Framework, Javascript and Jquery,  Open Weather API,  any CSS was done in line because of the small amount that was needed.
